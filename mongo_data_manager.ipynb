    "# Initialization of MongoDB Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the code initializes the necessary Python libraries and sets up the connection to a MongoDB database. Below is an explanation of each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Imported\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pymongo**: Used to work with MongoDB from Python. This library enables the creation of a client to interact with the database.\n",
    "- **datetime**: Provides classes for manipulating dates and times. It's used here to record timestamps when updating or inserting documents.\n",
    "- **json**: Supports JSON parsing. This module enables loading and parsing JSON data from files or strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connection String**: A string that specifies the MongoDB server to connect to, including credentials and other connection options.\n",
    "- **Client Setup**: The `MongoClient` object is created using the connection string, which facilitates operations like inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents.\n",
    "- **Database Selection**: Specifies the database (`require_rewrite_b`) from the MongoDB server to be used for operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is essential for performing any database operations that follow in the subsequent code.\n"

    "# Database Functions for JSON Data Management\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines various Python functions designed for managing JSON data in a MongoDB database. These functions enable adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting JSON templates and annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `add_or_update_json_template_in_db`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Adds or updates a JSON template in the MongoDB collection. These templates serve as the basis for annotations, which users can select and annotate.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `project_name` (str): Name of the project.\n",
    "  - `file_id` (str): ID of the file.\n",
    "  - `json_data` (dict): JSON data to be added.\n",
    "  - `overwrite` (bool): If true, updates the document if already exists; otherwise, inserts new.\n",
    "- **Returns**: None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `retrieve_json_template_by_file_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves the JSON template based on file ID from the MongoDB collection.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `file_id` (str): ID of the file.\n",
    "- **Returns**: JSON data as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `retrieve_annotations_by_file_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves all annotations for a given file ID. Initially, the JSON data in annotations contains fields set to null to indicate that they have not been annotated.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `file_id` (str): ID of the file.\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary containing annotations, indexed by username. As users interact with the annotation software, fields that are annotated are updated with actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `retrieve_annotation_by_user_and_file_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves the annotated file for a specific user and file ID. The annotations start with null values and are populated with data as the user performs annotations.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `file_id` (str): ID of the file.\n",
    "  - `username` (str): Username of the annotator.\n",
    "- **Returns**: JSON data of the annotated file, if found. Fields are initially set to null and updated as the user annotates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `delete_json_template_and_annotations_by_file_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Deletes a JSON template and all associated annotations based on file ID.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `file_id` (str): ID of the file.\n",
    "- **Returns**: None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `load_json_from_file`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Loads JSON data from a file.\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
