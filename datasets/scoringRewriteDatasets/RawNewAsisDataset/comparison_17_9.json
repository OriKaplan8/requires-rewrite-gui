Here are some tips to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Text Size**: Keep the text as close to the camera as possible. Adjust the font size to be as small as you can comfortably read. This helps keep your eyes near the camera, making it appear as if you're looking directly at your audience.\n\n2.\n\n**Reading Position**: Always read the top lines of the teleprompter script, as they are closest to the camera. Avoid reading the bottom lines as they come into view, as this will take your eyes further away from the camera.\n\n3.\n\n**Teleprompter Speed**: Adjust the teleprompter speed to match your natural speaking pace. This ensures you can comfortably read the top lines without rushing or slowing down too much.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a more engaging and professional video presentation, even with the camera positioned above your monitor.\n\n*[Try it now on your project? it's free!](https://bigvu.sng.link/Db284/ot3k?wpsrc=button&_smtype=3&utm_medium=chatbot&utm_source=bigvu.tv&utm_content=ai_script&utm_campaign=script_tools&_fallback_redirect=https://desk.bigvu.tv/welcome/init/business-profile).*", "utr_idx": 2, "speaker": "assistant", "context": ["Hi!

You can easily create a video reading from a script using BIGVU's teleprompter feature. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:\n\n1. **Write Your Script**:\n   - Click on the \"New Script\" button on the Projects page.\n   - Enter your script headline in \"Title of the script\". This will be the name of your video project.\n   - You can use the \"AI Rewrite Button\" to help generate a script if needed.\n\n2.\n\n**Set Up the Teleprompter**:\n   - Position yourself correctly based on whether you're recording horizontally or vertically. For horizontal recording, position yourself close to the camera. For vertical recording, position yourself in the middle of the screen.\n   - Make sure the text appears in a position where your eyes don't travel too much while reading. Keep your eyes on the first line to maintain direct eye contact with your audience.\n\n3. **Practice Reading**:\n   - Use the \"Read Only\" mode to practice reading your script from the teleprompter without recording. This will help you get comfortable with the script and avoid stumbling during the actual recording.\n\n4.\n\n**Record Your Video**:\n   - Once you're ready, hit the record button and start reading your script from the teleprompter. Remember to smile and relax before starting the recording to appear more natural on camera.\n\n5. **Edit and Finalize**:\n   - After recording, you can edit your video, add captions, and even include a thumbnail to make it more engaging.\n\nIf you need more detailed tips on using the teleprompter, you can check out our [Teleprompter Tips and Tricks](https://faq.bigvu.tv/en/articles/5095039-how-to-use-a-teleprompter-tips-and-tricks) guide.\n\n*Want to try out the Voice Generation?

From here, you have the option to upload and save the video to your project. Your video will be saved and available on both the web platform and mobile app.\n\n2. **Download**: You can directly save your video to your device by downloading it in your preferred file format (.webm or .mp4).\n\n3. **Save Changes**: If you have edited your video, once you are satisfied with the changes, you can save your video by clicking the \"Create\" button on the top right side of the page.\n\n4. **Record Again**: If needed, you also have the option to record again. Your previous video will be saved as a take in the project file.\n\nRemember, it is advisable to upload a video before downloading it in mp4 because downloading directly from a local take can be very long and requires a stable internet connection.\n\n*[Try it now on your project? it's free!](https://bigvu.sng.link/Db284/ot3k?wpsrc=button&_smtype=3&utm_medium=chatbot&utm_source=bigvu.tv&utm_content=ai_script&utm_campaign=script_tools&_fallback_redirect=https://desk.bigvu.tv/welcome/init/business-profile).*", "utr_idx": 2, "speaker": "assistant", "context": ["Hi!

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Decide on the Orientation**: Make sure your phone's rotation is enabled. You can check the settings on your phone to ensure this. For more details, you can refer to the [Instructions for Apple](https://intercom.help/bigvu/en/articles/3577255-how-to-enable-and-disable-orientation-lock-on-ios-devices) or [Instructions for Android](https://intercom.help/bigvu/en/articles/3577258-how-to-enable-and-disable-auto-rotate-screen-on-android).\n\n2.\n\n**Start a New Project**: Click the plus icon to open a new project. You have three choices to record a new video:\n   - **Record No Script**: Record directly without a script.\n   - **AI Magic Writer**: Use AI to help you write a business script and then record with a teleprompter.\n   - **New Script**: Write a script from scratch and record with a teleprompter.\n\n3. **Enable Auto-Rotate on Android**: If you're using an Android device, ensure that auto-rotate is on. You can do this by:\n   - Opening the notification bar and finding \"Auto-rotate\" in the Quick Settings menu.\n   - Alternatively, go to Settings > Display > System and turn on Auto-Rotate.\n\n4.\n\n**Change Aspect Ratio**: After recording, you can change the aspect ratio of your video to horizontal (16:9) using the BIGVU app. This is the standard YouTube aspect ratio and is perfect for landscape mode.\n\nWould you like to give it a try on your project? \n\n*[Try it now on your project? it's free!](https://bigvu.sng.link/Db284/ot3k?wpsrc=button&_smtype=3&utm_medium=chatbot&utm_source=bigvu.tv&utm_content=ai_script&utm_campaign=script_tools&_fallback_redirect=https://desk.bigvu.tv/welcome/init/business-profile).*", "utr_idx": 2, "speaker": "assistant", "context": ["Hi!

Disable Global DNS:\n   ```bash\n   ./sacli --key \"vpn.client.routing.reroute_dns\" --value \"false\" ConfigPut\n   ```\n\n3. Define the DNS Servers per User/Group. For example, to assign DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 for the \"test\" user:\n   ```bash\n   echo 'push \"dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4\"' > file.txt\n   echo 'push \"dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8\"' >> file.txt\n   ./sacli --user test -k prop_cc_cmds --value_file=./file.txt UserPropPut\n   ```\n\n4.
