                "answer": "I apologize for the confusion. The arguments I listed are actually the main arguments from the essay \"Things Fall Apart\" by Chinua Achebe, not Rhodes' arguments. \n\nTo explain and prove these arguments:\n\n1. Achebe aims to present the peculiarities of Igbo culture, including its beauties, wisdom, weaknesses, and the need for change. This is evident throughout the novel as Achebe portrays various aspects of Igbo culture, such as their religious beliefs, social structure, and traditions. He highlights both the positive aspects of the culture, such as their rich oral tradition and communal values, as well as the weaknesses, such as the rigid gender roles and the resistance to change.\n\n2. Achebe also aims to present a common humanity that transcends European and African identities. He challenges the notion of European superiority and portrays the Igbo people as complex individuals with their own unique culture and values. Through the character of Okonkwo, Achebe explores the universal themes of ambition, fear, and the struggle for identity that resonate with readers from different backgrounds.\n\n3. The Igbo society is based on the balance between male and female principles. Achebe emphasizes the importance of both male and female roles in Igbo society. He portrays the strength and influence of women in the community, such as the priestess Chielo and the powerful women's group, the Umuofia Women's Association. This highlights the significance of gender equality and the complementary nature of male and female principles in Igbo culture.\n\n4. Achebe depicts the past as admirable but not without flaws, as acknowledging faults adds credibility to the history he is trying to recreate. He presents the Igbo society as a complex and dynamic civilization with its own strengths and weaknesses. By acknowledging the flaws and imperfections, Achebe provides a more nuanced and realistic portrayal of the Igbo culture.\n\n5. The British are able to destroy the old Igbo culture through fear, trade, education, and treachery. Achebe explores the impact of colonialism on the Igbo society and the destructive consequences of British imperialism. He shows how the British exploit the vulnerabilities of the Igbo people, using fear tactics, introducing a new economic system, imposing their education, and manipulating local conflicts to gain control and undermine the traditional Igbo way of life.\n\n6. The novel suggests that all effective civilizations must learn to deal with perpetual human types and strive for goals such as wealth redistribution, a combining of male and female principles, compelling art and poetry, tolerance, democracy, morality, a sound system of justice, and the capacity for meaningful change. Achebe presents a vision of a successful civilization that embraces these ideals. Through the downfall of the Igbo society, he highlights the importance of adapting to changing circumstances, embracing inclusivity, and striving for justice and progress.\n\nThese arguments are supported by various events, characters, and themes depicted in the novel \"Things Fall Apart.\"",

Achebe seeks to depict a worthy precursor of a healthy and just modern civilization by highlighting the Igbo ability to incorporate a variety of humans in a well-functioning culture and by presenting certain basic political institutions that could form the foundation of a modern African state.",
