                "answer": "The ERP implementation at Vittor is driven by two main factors. The first factor is the increasing difficulty and cost of maintaining the old systems. The second factor is the lack of standards across different enterprise systems in various sites and countries. While the ERP is not the solution for defining standards, it helps in implementing and controlling them. The goal is to achieve transversal efficiency between different plants and trainings. The coordination among various actors and the balance between day-to-day activities and the project are crucial for the success of the implementation. Customizations and multiple system providers are seen as risks, and a risk assessment is being conducted to mitigate these issues. The implementation has not disrupted day-to-day activities in the plant, but there has been an economic impact due to the need for replacements. The main takeaway so far is the importance of thorough planning and attention to detail.",
