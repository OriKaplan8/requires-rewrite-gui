    "## Function: `process_dialog_data`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function processes dialog data from Asi's excel files, organizing it into a structured JSON format suitable for the annotation software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "- **xlsx_file_path** (`str`): The path to the Excel file containing the dialog data. This file should have a specific structure with columns like 'Unnamed: 0', 'sample_id', 'dialog_id', 'turn_id', 'question', and 'response'.\n",
    "- **output_path** (`str`, optional): The path where the output JSON file should be saved. If not provided, the function will return the structured data without writing it to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read Excel File**: The function starts by reading the Excel file from the specified path using pandas. It expects the file to be in a format that includes dialog information such as questions and responses.\n",
    "2. **Data Sorting**: Data is sorted based on an unnamed column assumed to keep the original ordering.\n",
    "3. **Indexing**: The 'sample_id' column is set as the DataFrame index for easy access to rows.\n",
    "4. **Grouping Data**: The data is grouped by 'dialog_id' to process each dialog separately.\n",
    "5. **Processing Dialogs**:\n",
    "   - It iterates through each dialog group.\n",
    "   - For each group, it constructs a list of dialog turns and gathers basic metadata for each turn such as the turn number, the original question, and the corresponding answer.\n",
    "   - If a turn is not the first in a sequence, the function creates another structure with the turn index as the key. This structure is used to store annotations and includes fields such as 'requires_rewrite' and 'enough_context', though these are initialized as `None` to be filled by the annotators later.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output**:\n",
    "   - If an output path is provided, the processed data dictionary is saved as a JSON file at the specified location.\n",
    "   - The function returns the data dictionary, which includes details about each dialog and its turns, even if no output file is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns:\n",
    "- **grouped_dict** (`dict`): A dictionary containing processed dialog data grouped by 'dialog_id'. Each entry includes the number of turns and a list of all turns in that dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Example:\n",
